          <p>
            Memberships renew monthly and include concierge sessions, academy access, and mentor-led
            community offerings. Members agree to keep account credentials secure and notify concierge
            of any changes to household information that impact service delivery.

          <p>
            We curate recommendations with care and transparency. Taylor-Made Baby Co. may receive
            affiliate commissions on certain registry items, and all partnerships are disclosed inside
            the dashboard. Members remain responsible for purchase decisions and vendor coordination
            beyond the concierge scope.

            Cancel or pause your membership at any time with 7 daysâ€™ notice before the next billing
            cycle. We do not offer partial refunds for unused concierge time; however, our team will
            happily transfer remaining guidance into curated resource kits upon request.
