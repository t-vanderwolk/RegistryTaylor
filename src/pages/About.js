      <p>
        Hi, I’m Taylor! I know how overwhelming the world of baby gear,
        registries, and family input can feel. With years of hands-on experience
        helping hundreds of parents choose strollers, car seats, nursery
        furniture, and everything in between, I’ve learned that baby prep is
        about more than products — it’s about peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of me as your go-to guide (and maybe your new best friend) for all
        things baby. I combine expert knowledge with a warm, supportive
        approach, making the process stress-free, personalized, and even fun.
        Whether you’re building a registry from scratch, designing a nursery, or
        smoothing out family gift expectations, I’ll be with you every step of
        the way.
      </p>
