This repository is now organized as a multi-tier project:

- `frontend/` – contains the existing React application and related build configuration.
- `backend/` – reserved for backend services or APIs (currently a placeholder).

Navigate into `frontend/` to continue working with the client app (`npm install`, `npm start`, etc.), and use `backend/` to introduce server functionality when ready.
